🚀 Just completed an exciting API Testing project using Playwright (JavaScript)!

This project was all about creating a clean, flexible, and secure automation framework tailored for robust API validation. 🔍✨

🔑 Key Highlights:

✅ Implemented two smart token-handling approaches:
   1️⃣ Fetched token via login API and saved to auth-token.txt for reuse
   2️⃣ Parsed token directly from JSON response and used it instantly in API calls

📂 Integrated dynamic test data from both JSON and CSV files for flexibility
🔐 Secured private credentials using .env to prevent hardcoding
♻️ Wrote reusable, maintainable, and scalable scripts for long-term growth

I'm always exploring better ways to automate and elevate software quality. Onward and upward! 💻🚀
